AjaxEngine
==========

A simple ajax-powered engine for nice, tidy website interfaces

This has been developed on-and-off as needed in somewhat of an ad-hoc manner, to support needs as they arose. It's far from perfect but does provide a nice, robust, clean way of developing efficient ajax interfaces with fragment-based navigation. Check individual files for inline comments

It won't run at all in its present state, as it's missing many other componenets, but serves as a guide to its own core structure and how its processes work
